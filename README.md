## Introduction

Hello there👋! Here a series of projects that I completed during my first semester of university to practice and improve my programming skills💻

- The first project, called MenuClient, is a console application that simulates the client side of a restaurant ordering system. Users can browse the menu and select items to order, and the application displays a list of the selected items and the total price at the end. This project was written in Java, but I also rewrote it in C++ and Python as additional practice.

- The second project, called MenuAdmin, is a console application that simulates the admin side of a restaurant ordering system. It allows the admin to manage the menu by adding, deleting, and modifying items and setting new prices. This project was also written in Java.

- The third project is an extension of the first two projects, and it demonstrates the use of OOP concepts such as inheritance. It combines the functionality of MenuClient and MenuAdmin into a single application using OOP principles.

I hope that these projects will be helpful for others who are also interested in improving their programming abilities🖇. If you find these projects useful, please consider supporting me by starring this repository⭐️🤗
